**Human I/O** is a research project that aims to propose a unified approach to
detecting a wide range of Situationally Induced Impairments and Disabilities
(SIIDs) by gauging the availability of human input/output channels. Leveraging
egocentric vision, multimodal sensing and reasoning with large language models.
